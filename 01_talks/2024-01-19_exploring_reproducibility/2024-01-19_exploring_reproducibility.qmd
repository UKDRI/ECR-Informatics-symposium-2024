## Code Review

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
-   [Join the team!](https://github.com/orgs/UKDRI/teams/code-review)
-   How does the community want it to be used?
    -   Quick second pair of eyes on code snippet?
    -   Methodological advice (QC cutoff, etc)?
    -   Full review of project codebase?

## Code Review continued

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
-   Acknowledgements for review?
    -   GitHub has metrics
    -   Authorship? Establish group rules, or discuss ad-hoc?
    -   Minimal acknowledgement in GitHub Contributors file for reviewers?

## Proposed workflow

(@)  Make a repo on DRI GitHub Org (perhaps using [the template](https://github.com/H-Mateus/dri-reproducibility-template)!)
(@)  Write and publish a [registered report](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports) outlining the project
(@)  Gather/analyse data
    i)  Make ADDI workspace?
    ii) Use existing pipelines if applicable (Nextflow)
    iii) Containerise software environment (probably at end of project)

## Proposed workflow continued

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
(@)  Publish all the things!
    -   Pre-print -\> [diamond open access](https://www.coalition-s.org/diamond-open-access/)
    -   Data on relevant public repositories + ADDI?
    -   generate DOI for code repo via [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
